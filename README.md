Today, I'm writing this tutorial to create a resource that will help you learn HTML in less than 15 days. Here's a recommended timeline for learning HTML5 with projects, based on your educational background:

- **If you are in high school**: 12-15 days 
- **If you are in college**: 5-6 days 
- **If you already know any programming language**: 2-3 days 

If you are take more time that's mean you are not doing practice. So, I recommend you to do practice as much as you can.

What is HTML?
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

HTML5 is the latest version of the `Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)` used to create web pages. It introduces new features, elements, and APIs to enhance web development. HTML5 is designed to be more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly than its predecessors.

Some key features of HTML5 include:
- New semantic elements for better document structure
- Improved multimedia support with native audio and video embedding
- Enhanced form controls and validation
- Canvas API for drawing graphics
- Geolocation API for location-based services
- Web Storage API for local storage
- Web Workers API for background processing

By mastering HTML5, you can create modern, responsive, and interactive web applications that provide a seamless user experience across devices and platforms.
